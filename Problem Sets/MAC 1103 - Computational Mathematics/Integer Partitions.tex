\title{MAC 1103: Integer Partitions}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item List and enumerate all compositions of $8$ into $3$ parts. Next, enumerate the partitions of $8$ into $3$ parts.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ in which every part is odd is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ with unequal parts.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ in which no integer occurs more than twice as a part is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts not divisible by $3$.

\item List all self-conjugate partitions of $15$.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ is equal to the number of partitions of $2n$ into exactly $n$ parts.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ with $k$ parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ with largest part $k$.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ into three parts such that the largest is not larger than the sum of the other two is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into $2$s, $3$s, and $4$s.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $2n + k$ into $n + k$ parts is independent of $k$.

\item Show that the number of self-conjugate partitions of $n$ is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct odd parts.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ in which odd parts are not repeated equals the number of partitions of $n$ in which every part is either odd or a multiple of $4$.

\item Show that the number of partitions of $n$ with $k$ parts and largest part $m$ is equal to the number of partitions of $n - k$ with $m - 1$ parts, none of which is greater than $k$.
