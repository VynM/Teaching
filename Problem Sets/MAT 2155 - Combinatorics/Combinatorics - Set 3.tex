\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item In a class of $76$ students, $26$ have a brother, $29$ have a sister, and $20$ have both. How many have no siblings?

\item Number of positive integers between $1$ and $100$ not divisible by any of $2$, $3$, and $5$.

\item Number of positive integers less than or equal to $p^a q^b$, not divisible by either one of $p$ and $q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers and $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.

\item Number of derangements of $n$ objects.

\item Show that the proportion of permutations of $1, 2, \ldots, n$ with no consecutive pair $i$, $i + 1$ for any $i$ is $\frac{n + 1}{n\,e}$.

\item Number of distributions of $30$ distinct objects into $3$ distinct boxes such that no box is empty.

\item Number of subsets of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$ such that the sum of all the elements in the subset is odd.

\item If $A$ and $B$ are finite sets of cardinalities $n$ and $m$ respectively, where $n \ge m$, then show that the number of surjective functions from $A$ to $B$ is $\sum\limits_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \binom m k (m - k)^n$.
