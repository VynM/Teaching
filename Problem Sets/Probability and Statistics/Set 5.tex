\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Suppose that the number of items produced in a factory during one week is a random variable with mean $500$ and variance $100$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What can be said about the probability that this week's production will be at least $1000$?
	\item What can be said about the probability that this week's production will be between $400$ and $600$?
\end{enumerate}

\item If the time required to complete a task is a random variable with mean $20$ minutes and standard deviation $3$ minutes, find the smallest time frame such that the probability that the task will be completed within the time frame is at least $0.75$.

\item The number of visitors to a webpage per minute follows a Poisson distribution. If the average number of visitors per minute is $4$, what is the probability that the webpage receives
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item exactly four visitors in one minute?
	\item at least two visitors in one minute?
\end{enumerate}

\item If $X$ is a Poisson variate such that $3 P[X = 2] = 2P[X = 1]$, then what is $E[X]$?

\item  It is observed in a communication channel that $90\%$ of the messages sent are received without any error. Find the probability that among $18$ messages sent through the channel
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item at least $16$ are received without any error
	\item at most $14$ are received without any error.
\end{enumerate}

\item If $X \sim B(6, p)$, and $P[X = 2] = 9P[X = 4]$, then find $P[X \le 3]$.

\item In a certain factory producing blades, there is a small probability of $\frac{1}{500}$ for any blade to be defective. The blades are supplied in packets of $10$. Calculate the approximate number of packets containing
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item no defective
	\item one defective
	\item two defective
	\item at least two defective
\end{enumerate}
blades in a consignment of $10000$ packets.

\item One per thousand of a population is subject to certain kinds of accidents each year. Given that an insurance company has insured $5,000$ persons from the population, find the probability that at most $2$ of them will incur this accident.

\item An airline company, having observed that $5\%$ of the persons making reservations on a flight do not show up for the flight, sells $100$ seats on a plane that has $95$ seats. What is the probability that there will be a seat available for every person who shows up for the flight?

\item If $X$ is a binomial variate with mean $3$, such that $P[X = 3] = 2P[X = 2]$, find $V[X]$.

\item $X$ is a Poisson variate and the probability that $X$ is even is twice the probability that it is odd. Determine $P[X = 0]$.

\item  If $X$ is exponentially distributed with $E(X) = 2$, then find the value of $a$ such that $P(X \le a) = P(X \ge a)$.\\

\item Suppose that the duration in minutes of a phone call follows an exponential distribution with mean $5$ minutes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find the probability that the duration of a particular call
\begin{enumerate}
	\item will exceed $5$ minutes
	\item will be between $5$ and $6$ minutes
	\item will be less than $3$ minutes
	\item will be less than $6$ minutes, given that it was greater than $3$ minutes.
\end{enumerate}
\item Suppose exactly $100$ such phone calls are received every day. Find the probability that on a given day
\begin{enumerate}
	\item every phone call lasted longer than $8$ minutes
	\item at least $4$ phone calls lasted longer than $8$ minutes.
\end{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that in one week, there are at least $3$ days on each which there were at least $4$ phone calls that lasted longer than $8$ minutes.
\end{enumerate}

\item A random variable $X$ follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\alpha = 3$. Compute
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $P(2X > 1)$.
	\item $P(X > s + t \mid X > t)$, where $s, t > 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\item A book of $200$ pages contains $100$ misprints distributed randomly throughout its pages. If one page is selected at random and examined, what is the probability that it contains
\begin{enumerate}
	\item no misprints?
	\item at least $2$ misprints?
\end{enumerate}

\item Buses start from a certain station at intervals of $45$ minutes. What is the probability that a person reaching the station at a random point in time will have to wait for at least $30$ minutes?
\end{enumerate}
