\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0.3em]
\item If $\overline X$ is the mean of a random sample of size $5$ from a normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma^2 = 125$, determine $c$ such that $\Prob[P[\overline X < c] = 0.9$.

\item If $X \sim N(\mu, 100)$, find $n$ such that $\Prob[|\overline X - \mu| < 5] = 0.954$.

\item Let $\overline X$ be the mean of a sample of size $75$ from a distribution that has pdf $f(x) = 1$, $0 < x < 1$. Find an approximate probability $\Prob[0.45 < \overline X < 0.55]$.

\item Compute $\Prob[2.3 < S^2 < 22.2]$, where $S^2$ is the variance of a sample of size $6$ from a normal distribution with variance $12$.

\item If $X \sim N(0, 16))$ and $Y \sim N(1, 9)$ respectively, and $\overline X$ and $\overline Y$ are the means of samples of size $25$ each from these two distributions respectively, find $\Prob[\overline X > \overline Y]$.

\item If $X$ has a distribution defined by the pdf $f(x) = 3x^2$, $0 < x < 1$, compute an approximate probability that the mean of a sample of size $15$ taken from this population lies between $\frac 3 5$ and $\frac 4 5$.

\item If $Y \sim B(n, 0.55)$, find an approximation for the smallest value of $n$ such that $\Prob\bqty{\frac Y n > \frac 1 2} \ge 0.95$.

\item Let $Y$ be the sum of the outcomes obtained when a fair, six-sided die is rolled $12$ times. Using Central Limit Theorem, compute $\Prob[36 \le Y \le 48]$ approximately.

\item Consider a random sample of size $72$ from a distribution having pdf $f(x) = \frac 1 {x^2}$, $x > 1$. What is the probability that more than $50$ of the observations in the sample are less than $3$?

\item Forty-eight measurements are recorded to several decimal places, and each of these is rounded off to the nearest integer. The sum of the original $48$ measurements is approximated by the sum of these integers. Assuming that the round-off errors are independent and each is uniformly distribution in $(-0.5, 0.5)$, compute an approximate probability that the sum of the integers is within two units of the true sum.

\item If $X \sim N(10, 9)$ and $Y \sim N(3, 4)$, find $\Prob[\overline X > 2 \overline Y]$ where both samples have size $4$.

\item Compute $\Prob[0 < \overline X < 6, 55.2 < S^2 < 145.6]$, if $X \sim N(3, 100)$ and $n = 25$.

\item Approximate the probability that the sum of $16$ independent random variables, each uniformly distributed in $[0, 1]$, exceeds $10$.

\item Compute an approximate probability that $\overline X$ is between $7$ and $9$, if $X \sim \Gamma(2, \frac 1 4)$ and $n = 128$.

\item A fair, six-sided die is rolled until the total of all outcomes exceeds $400$. Approximate the probability that this will require more than $140$ rolls.

\item The lifetime, in hours, of a type of electric bulb has expected value $500$ and standard deviation $80$. Approximate the probability that the mean of the lifetimes of a sample of $n$ such bulbs is greater than $525$, when
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $n = 4$
\item $n = 16$
\item $n = 36$
\item $n = 64$.
